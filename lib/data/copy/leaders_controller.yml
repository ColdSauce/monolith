    Hey <%= info[:name] %>! Noticed you just filled out the intake form â€“ welcome to Hack Club! My name is Hackbot, I'm our Slack's friendly robotic helper.

    I can respond to specific commands you give me. For example, if you type `hackbot gif pugs`, I'll send you a gif of some adorable dogs. If you want a list of all the things I know how to do, just type `hackbot help`.

    I'm pretty basic right now, but I learn new things every week. In fact, if you have any suggestions just talk to `@harrison` or `@msw`!

    If you're the club's point of contact (Kyle should explain what this is), I'll be reaching out to you every week on Friday to find out the latest information about your club.

    Happy hacking!
