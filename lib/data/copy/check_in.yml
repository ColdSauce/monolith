first_greeting: >
    Hey <%= info[:first_name] %>! I'm Hackbot, Hack Club's friendly robot helper.

    I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way :slightly_smiling_face:

    To start, did you have a club meeting this week?

greeting: Hello. And, again, welcome to the Hack Club Weekly Check In. I am required to start by asking you if you had a meeting this past week. (yes/no)

meeting_confirmation:
    positive: As part of a required test protocol, I am required to tell you that you are doing `quite well`! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today")
    negative: How unfortunate. Why did the meeting not occur? Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?
    invalid: To ensure the safe performance of all Hack Club Weekly Check In activities, please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.

no_meeting_reason: Gotcha. Hope you have a hack-tastic weekend!

day_of_week:
    unknown: Incomprehensible message. Try saying something simpler, like "tuesday" or "thursday".
    invalid: My records indicate this date did not occur in the past week. Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (For example, `25`)

judgement:
    ok: Adequate input value. You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    good: <%= info[:count] %> is very not completely bad. You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    great: <%= info[:count] %> is genuinely mildly impressive! You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    awesome: Good job getting <%= info[:count] %> hackers! You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    impossible: Good job getting `MAX_VALUE_EXCEEDED` participants. I am required to inform you that you've done **very well**.

attendance:
    invalid:
      - Input invalid. Please input a single number.
      - Input value invalid. That's the opposite of what input values should be.
    not_realistic: Make sure your number is a real number greater than 0 (for example, 10 or 25).
    valid: <%= info[:judgement] %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with? I can submit a Hack Club Feedback Report (just make sure to include everything in a single message). If not, please respond with "no".

notes:
    no_notes: Confirmed. Have a good weekend.
    had_notes: Your report has been filed. Expect to hear from a Hack Club Report Response Representative within the next `UNDEFINED TIME_UNIT`. That's _very_ fast.

follow_ups:
    first: "Hey! Just wanted to follow-up on this. :wink:"
    second: "Hello"
    third: "Are you still there?"
