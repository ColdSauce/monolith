first_greeting: >
    Hey <%= info[:first_name] %>! I'm Hackbot, Hack Club's friendly robot helper.

    I'll be reaching out to you every week, typically on Fridays, to check in and see how your club's doing. I'll be in the loop every step of the way :slightly_smiling_face:

    Before we get started, I just wanted to let you know that I've started cosplaying as GLaDOS and I've learned a few new tricks (thanks to some awesome suggestions that y'all sent to my creators).

    Try saying `hackbot gif cave johnson` or `hackbot stats` in a channel that I'm in.

    Let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by 8am PST on Monday, <%= Date.parse('Monday').to_formatted_s(:short) %>. Did you have a club meeting this week?

greeting: >
    Hey there!

    Before we get started with check-ins, I just wanted to let you know that I've started cosplaying as GLaDOS (a character from the Portal series) and have learned a few new tricks (thanks to some awesome suggestions that y'all sent to my creators).

    Try saying `@hackbot gif cave johnson` or `@hackbot stats` in a channel that I'm in.

    Now let's get started — please be sure to complete this check-in by 8am PST on Monday, <%= Date.parse('Monday').to_formatted_s(:short) %>.

    Hello. And, again, welcome to the Hack Club Weekly Check In. I am required to start by asking you if you had a meeting this past week. (yes/no)

meeting_confirmation:
    positive: As part of a required test protocol, I am required to tell you that you are doing `quite well`! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today")
    negative: How unfortunate. Why did the meeting not occur? Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?
    invalid: To ensure the safe performance of all Hack Club Weekly Check In activities, please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.

no_meeting_reason: >
    I understand. Thank you for participating in the Hack Club Weekly Check In experiment. Goodbye!

day_of_week:
    unknown: I am unable to decode this message. Provide simpler input, such as "tuesday" or "thursday".
    invalid: My records indicate this date did not occur in the past week. Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: Once again, excellent work. Please provide an estimate as to how many attendees your previous meeting captured? (For example, `25`)

judgement:
    ok: Adequate input value. You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    good: <%= info[:count] %> is very not completely bad. You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    great: <%= info[:count] %> is genuinely mildly impressive! You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    awesome: Good job getting <%= info[:count] %> hackers! You, `SUBJECT_NAME_HERE`, must be the pride of `SUBJECT_HOMETOWN_HERE`.
    impossible: Good job getting `MAX_VALUE_EXCEEDED` participants. I am required to inform you that you've done **very well**.

attendance:
    invalid:
      - Input invalid. Please input a single number.
      - Input value invalid. That's the opposite of what input values should be.
    not_realistic: Make sure your number is a real number greater than 0 (for example, 10 or 25).
    valid: <%= info[:judgement] %> Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with? I can submit a Hack Club Feedback Report (just make sure to include everything in a single message). If not, please respond with "no".

notes:
    no_notes: Your report has been filed. Thank you for helping us help you help us all. Have a good rest break.
    had_notes: Your report has been filed. Expect to hear from a Hack Club Report Response Representative within the next `UNDEFINED TIME_UNIT`. That's _very_ fast.

follow_ups:
    first: "Hey! Just wanted to follow-up on this. :wink:"
    second: "Hello"
    third: "Are you still there?"
