    These are stats for your club at <%= info[:school_name] %>!

    In the <%= info[:days_alive] %> days you've been checking in with me, you've had <%= info[:total_meetings] %> meetings. Across all of your recorded club meetings, on average you have <%= info[:avg_attendance] %> attend your meetings.
